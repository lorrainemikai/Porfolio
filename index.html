  <p>in this project i am trying to bring up the places were people can go out for their holidays</p>

    <h2> <i>ABOUT ME <i></i></h2>
    <h2 ><u>my background </u></h2>
    <p>i grew up an only child who always got in trouble with her mother because i woud always want to figure out and google things that were beyond my age. as stated above (i guess) i got a really great interest in programming when i was quite young or rather in tech stuff which i later came to learn was called <em>programming</em>.
    </p>
    <h2><u>my interests and hobbies</u></h2>
    <p > i share tons of interests and hobbies.
      some that people may have and some that i think to be my own.
      some of them <ol>
          <li>swimming</li>
          <li>singing</li>
          <li>music</li>
          <li>parkour</li>
          <li>technology</li> </ol>

      </p>
      <p>i am interested in the question 'how' maybe that is how i got an interest in programming mainly because every time i get to an app the first question i ask myself is 'how was this app created and how did he get it to be this big'.So yeah thats basicaly who i am </p>
